3. Configure source csv to local path in each transformation file
4. Configure your local db connection in 'Table Output' in each transformation file
5. Run to create tables and populate them

3. Configure each 'Table Input' in each file for your local db connection where dimensions were created
4. Configure 'Table Output' in each file for your local db connection
